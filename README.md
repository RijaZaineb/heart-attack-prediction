# Heart Attack Prediction with Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of heart attacks, aiming to enhance early diagnosis and intervention in healthcare. Using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, I compared the performance of five models - Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - to identify the most effective approach for predicting high-risk patients. The study also explored gender-specific risk factors, pinpointing crucial features such as chest pain types and maximum heart rate achieved.

By utilizing these models, this work has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals earlier, ultimately improving patient outcomes through proactive treatment and prevention strategies.

### Key tools: 
Python, Data Preprocessing (Pandas), Scikit-learn, Data Visualization (Matplotlib)
